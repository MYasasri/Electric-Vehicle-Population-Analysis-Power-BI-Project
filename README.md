# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis | Power BI Project

This repository contains my **Electric Vehicle Population Analysis** project built using **Microsoft Power BI**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze electric vehicle (EV) population data to uncover adoption trends, patterns, and insights that support decision-making and sustainability understanding.

Project Objectives
The main objectives of this Electric Vehicle (EV) Population Analysis project are:
- To analyze the growth and adoption of electric vehicles across different regions
- To understand the distribution of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
- To identify trends based on model year, manufacturer, and geographic location
- To create interactive dashboards that support data-driven decision making
- To enhance skills in data visualization, DAX, and Power BI reporting

#Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information related to electric vehicles, including:
- Vehicle Make & Model
- Model Year
- Electric Vehicle Type (BEV / PHEV)
- Geographic Location (State / City)
- Electric Range
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
- Vehicle Count / Registration Data

The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power BI Power Query to handle:
- Missing values
- Data type corrections
- Column standardization
- Filtering irrelevant or duplicate entries

#Project Overview

In this project, I explored EV data to:

- Visualize **EV distribution by states and cities**
- Compare **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)** vs **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)**
- Analyze **manufacturer and model-wise data**
- Study **year-wise growth trends**
- Create **interactive visuals**, slicers, and KPIs to enhance insight discovery  
This dashboard strengthens analytical skills in data cleaning, DAX calculations, and report design using Power BI. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
